ADV00MODELS:
- Unknown source file: adv00_stationsquare/place03/loadsfin_gards.nja

ADV01MODELS:
- Unknown source file for the EC_TRANSFORM texlist

ADV02MODELS:
- Unknown source files: mra_f_road.nja, mr_soft_4plane.nja, mrobj_s_tr2ext.nja (possibly parts of Tornado runway)
- Assumption: 95E14 is figure/amy/models/a_headitem_a_headitem.nja, a clone of figure/amy/models/a_itemhanma_a_itemh.nja.sa1mdl that is normally split from ADV1CMODELS. "a_headitem" seems like the wrong name to call a hammer, but there are no other Amy powerups in ADV02MODELS, so I decided to take that name.
- ADV02MR02_OBJECTS 173-176 are split as mrobj_s_numakabe.nja

miles_tail_u contains data for the right tail (as in "u", a possible reading of 右)
The last model that doesn't have a pair is in miles_tails_t
