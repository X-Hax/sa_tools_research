# SA Tools (Research)
Additional tools related to hacking Sonic Adventure and other games. 

This repository hosts tools that are no longer part of the main [SA Tools](https://github.com/X-Hax/sa_tools) package.

The tools hosted on this repository are for advanced users that know how to use the command line and compile tools manually.

**Building SA Tools (Research)**

Make sure the repository is cloned recursively with the submodule. Open the `sa_tools_research.sln` solution in Visual Studio, wait for Nuget packages to restore and then it is ready to compile.

Automatic builds via AppVeyor are also available. Note that AppVeyor build artifacts are cleaned up automatically, so if the repo isn't updated in a while you'll need to build it yourself or wait for an update.
